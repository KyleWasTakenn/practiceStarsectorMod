Faction notes:
The faction operates similar to pirates. It leans chaotic evil/chaotic neutral. The faction holds a large marketshare in Heavy weapons, Marines, and Harvested organs.
Operates in the fringes of the sector through outposts.
Fleet doctrine should focus on small ships, and contain mostly EMP weaponry and phase ships. This faction makes its credits through smuggling, bounty hunting, ransom, and covert operations.

Inspirations:
Threat, Abyssal shrouds, Remnants.

Doctrine:
- Small ships, phase ships, EMP, geurilla warfare & wolfpack tactics.
- Very, very few (or no) large ships.
     - Frigate and Destoryer sized logistics ships with phase.

Focuses:
- Raiding, smuggling, geurilla warfare.

Theme:
Pirates, Mid/High tech, AI, cult influence, mad scientists
- Kitbashed phase ships
	- Want to keep in line with how the Starsector vanilla pirates operate. Stolen ships with modifications.
	- Can have original ships too, but want to keep them from being too fancy.
- Chaotic evil / Chaotic neutral
	- No illegal commodities, very few allies, out for themselves.
	- Makes most of their money off of Smuggling, bounty-hunting, 
- Influence from Threat, or Shroud. Possibly 'cultic'
	- Think almost luddic path, but the opposite side of the coin.
	- Largely ran by AI, 'worships' other AI and things the church would deem heretical.
	
How does the player fit in?:
- Humans have 3 roles in the faction: Slaves, Organ bags, and Spies/agents. The player would be the latter.
	- Though the ships and majority of their society are largely operated by AI through nanobots and robot bodies, humans still make the best spies. [FACTION NAME] Genetically modifies, cybernetically enhances, and trains
	humans from birth to fill this role. Some may specialize in piloting, while some specialize as agents.



Idea board:
- Spawns stations similar to pirates / pathers.
	- Stations always have mines.
- Heavily uses agents in Nexerelin.
- Lots of smugglers
	- Stations mass-produce harvested organs, drugs, maybe even produce AI cores.
	- Stations should also produce a lot of heavy weapons, and marines. Possibly using a custom marines item that is slightly stronger (and to match the theme of the faction using mostly AI / robots)
- Modified version of Phase field (Possibly slightly stronger, but mostly for flavor)
- Modified version of ground defenses (Possibly slightly stronger, but mostly for flavor)
- Maybe require SiC mod as a dependancy and make the majority of ships automated
    - Possibly a custom XO tree.

CUSTOM INDUSTRIES:
- Organ-producing building to fit flavor.
	- Possibly take their victims phyrexia-style, and use some sort of stem-cell treatment to infinitely harvest organs.
	- Could also be flavored as a task force / privateer who brings back organs from bounty-hunter targets.
	- Could also produce artifical organs (custom commodity)
- Marine-producing building to fit flavor.
- Drug-producing building to fit flavor.

- Stations always have mines and planetary shield
- Custom station
